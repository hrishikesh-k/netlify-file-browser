# Contributing to Netlify File Browser

We love your input! We want to make contributing to this project as easy and transparent as possible, whether it's:

- Reporting a bug
- Discussing the current state of the code
- Submitting a fix
- Proposing new features
- Becoming a maintainer

## We develop with GitHub

We use GitHub to host code, to track issues and feature requests, as well as accept pull requests.

Pull requests are the best way to propose changes to the codebase. We actively welcome your pull requests. To get started:

1. Fork the repo and create your branch from `v2`.
2. Issue that pull request!

## Any contributions you make will be under the MIT Software License

In short, when you submit code changes, your submissions are understood to be under the same [MIT License](http://choosealicense.com/licenses/mit/) that covers the project. Feel free to contact the maintainers if that's a concern.

## Report bugs using GitHub's issues

We use GitHub issues to track public bugs. Report a bug by [opening a new issue](https://github.com/Hrishikesh-K/netlify-file-browser/issues), it's that easy!

## Write bug reports with detail, background, and sample code

**Great Bug Reports** tend to have:

- A quick summary and/or background
- Steps to reproduce (be specific)
- What you expected would happen
- What actually happens
- Notes (possibly including why you think this might be happening, or stuff you tried that didn't work)

Developers *love* thorough bug reports.

## Use a Consistent Coding Style

Maintaining a codebase with multiple contributors would be a pain if the code is not consistent. Here are some general guidelines to follow:

* 2 spaces for indentation rather than tabs
* HTML attributes on new lines
* Attributes should be sorted alphabetically (except Vue directives: `v-` should be at the end)
* Don't use shorthand JavaScript syntax unnecessarily, especially inside `<script>` or in the API endpoints.
